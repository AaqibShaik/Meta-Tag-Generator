## Meta-Tag-Generator

### What are Meta Tags?
Meta tags provide information about the webpage in the HTML of the document. This information is called "metadata" and while it is not displayed on the page itself, it can be read by search engines and web crawlers.

Search engines such as Google use metadata from meta tags to understand additional information about the webpage. They can use this information for ranking purposes, to display snippets in search results, and sometimes they can ignore meta tags.

### Why this project?
It’s not that difficult to make meta tags but I’ve made it simple for you by offering you this free metatag generator. By filling out all the sections of this code generator, it will create the perfect meta tags. Then just “copy & paste” the meta tags into the HTML of the source of your index page and you're ready to go.
